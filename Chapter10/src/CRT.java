 /* 
  1.	What is a GUI?
A GUI is a graphical user interface.

2.	Explain how code is executed in an even-driven application
The code is executed by an interaction of a user, for example a button click by the user. 

3.	Can components be added directly to a frame?
Components aren’t added directly to the Jframe. A user would have to add a Jpanel onto the frame first. 

4.	Can a label respond to events?
No, the label can only display texts or images. Not respond to events or the user.

5.	What do you think a GUI needs to be run from an event-dispatching thread?
It needs to be run from an event-dispatching thread to ensure the first even handler is done executing before the next one executes. 

6.	What is the difference between a label and a button?
A label displays texts or images, it cannot be interacted with by the user, but a button is used to be interacted with by the user.
