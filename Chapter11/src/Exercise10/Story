We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
